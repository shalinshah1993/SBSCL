#### Description
The Systems Biology Simulation Core Library (SBSCL) provides an efficient and exhaustive Javaâ„¢ implementation of methods to interpret the content of models encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language ([SBML](http://sbml.org)) and its numerical solution. This library is based on the [JSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML) project and can be used on every operating system for which a Java Virtual Machine is available. Please note that this project does not contain any user interface, neither a command-line interface, nor a graphical user interface. This project has been developed as a pure programming library. To support the [MIASE](http://co.mbine.org/standards/miase) effort, it understands [SED-ML](http://sed-ml.org) files. Its abstract type and interface hierarchy facilitates the implementation of further community standards, such as [CellML](https://www.cellml.org).

## Getting started

For an introduction of how to use this library, please open the javadoc [homepage](https://draeger-lab.github.io/SBSCL/apidocs/overview-summary.html). There you can find instructions and source code examples, including some use cases. Once a maven build is ran, the binaries will be generated in the target folder. This folder will also include a JAR files of the simulation core library to work with.

## File structure

Just a brief explanation of the folders and files contained in this distribution.

Most importantly, see 
 * the [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) file for instruction to run maven build
 * the docs folder containing an exhaustive documentation under apidocs

The package structure in more detail:
```
 /
 |- docs           -> Contains code for the maven built website
 |- src            -> The main source folder containing all the code and test files
    |- assembly    -> assembly files for maven plugins
    |- lib         -> 3rd party libraries needed for compilation and execution
    |- main        -> Core java files of simulation library
    |- test        -> JUnit test files along with resources required
    |- site        -> Contains markup files, old javadoc, site.xml and other website 
                      resources 
 |- LICENSE.txt    -> the license, under which this project is distributed
 |- pom.xml        -> Maven file for building the project
 |- README.md      -> this file
```
